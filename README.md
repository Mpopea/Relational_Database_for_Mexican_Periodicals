# Relational_Database_for_Mexican_Periodicals
 Data tidying and wrangling performed in order to transform my input spreadsheet into a relational database

This dataset corresponds to the corpus that I analyse in my PhD thesis on the function of literary translation in Mexican periodicals at the turn of the century and during the first decades of the twentieth century (1894-1932). In it, I focus on various cultural magazines published during this period, collecting metadata for all the translated texts that appeared in them.

The project of creating a relational database arose after I attended the Applied Data Analysis workshop at the 2019 Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School. I had until then been working with my input spreadsheet directly in R. My goal is now to tidy my data and split it into various tables, using mainly pandas.

Folders in this repository correspond to separate tasks that I have carried out in order to tidy my data. A model of input spreadsheet will be available in the root of the repo. As I still am in the inputting phase, I will use temporary practice datasets which will be located in their respective folders. When all the tidying and wrangling will be complete, I will gather all the code in a definitive file and provide the complete dataset.
